I had tried my program with  DEV-C++ and its working (had no time for g++)
Sorry my program will calculate white space probabilyties but couldnt manage
to read whitespaces (for example SPACE) as a whitespace from user.
and Insited Homewor-2.pdf there is no information about user input but you(Dilara)
said(through email) that there will be no menu but if user enters...
school is in holiday so i had no one to clarify my confusably. Email cannot
return instantly so for myself i had did everything the homework instarction
asked.
Thank you
